The service generates feeds of recent papers that are specific and relevant to each user's scientific interests by leveraging state of the art embeddings and clustering techniques. Meta also calculates article-level inferred Eigenfactor® scores which are used to rank the papers. This paper discusses Meta's approach to query formulation and ranking to improve retrieval of recently published, and yet un-cited academic publications.\", 'title': 'Personalized Feed/Query-formulation, Predictive Impact, and Ranking'"}

Much of this progress can be attributed to the vast amounts of textual data that have become available and to a concomitant weakening of theoretical commitments, so as to be able to use the data in information extraction, sentiment analysis, question answering, etc. Along with weakened commitments to the demands of particular theories, has been a greater willingness to consider what can be learned from textual data and from various forms of annotation, in English and in other languages as well. This paper briefly summarizes (1) changing assumptions about discourse structure; (2) recent work on lexico-syntactic grounding of low-level discourse structure and frameworks for higher-level discourse structure that recognize differences in genre; and (3) suggestions for addressing some of the challenges still facing us. For more detail, the reader is encouraged to go to the references themselves.\", 'title': 'Discourse Processing for Text Analysis: Recent Successes, Current Challenges'"}
